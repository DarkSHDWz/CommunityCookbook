Here's a basic recipe for making homemade boba (also known as tapioca pearls) for bubble tea:

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup tapioca starch (you can find this at most grocery stores or Asian markets)
- 1/2 cup water
- Brown sugar or honey (optional, for sweetening)
- Your choice of tea or flavored drink (for bubble tea)
- Milk or non-dairy milk (optional, for creamy bubble tea)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Dough:** In a mixing bowl, combine the tapioca starch and water. Mix until it forms a dough-like consistency. If it's too dry, add a little more water; if it's too sticky, add more tapioca starch. Knead the dough until it's smooth.

2. **Shape the Pearls:** Roll the dough into small balls, about 1/4 inch in diameter. You can make them slightly larger if you prefer bigger boba. Make sure the balls are uniform in size to ensure even cooking.

3. **Cook the Boba:** Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the boba pearls to the pot. Stir gently to prevent them from sticking to the bottom. Let them cook for about 15-20 minutes or until they float to the surface.

4. **Rinse and Sweeten:** Once the boba pearls are cooked, drain them and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process. If you'd like sweetened boba, you can toss them in brown sugar or honey while they're still warm.

5. **Prepare Your Bubble Tea:** Brew your tea or prepare your flavored drink according to your preference. If you're making creamy bubble tea, add milk or a non-dairy alternative to your brewed tea.

6. **Assemble Your Drink:** Add the cooked boba pearls to the bottom of a glass. Pour your tea or flavored drink over the boba pearls. Add ice if desired.

7. **Serve and Enjoy:** Insert a wide straw into the glass and enjoy your homemade bubble tea!

Feel free to customize your bubble tea by experimenting with different flavors of tea, syrups, or toppings like fruit jelly or whipped cream. Enjoy!
